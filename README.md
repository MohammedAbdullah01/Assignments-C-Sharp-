# Assignments: Basic to Advanced Concepts

This set of assignments covers essential programming concepts in C#, from simple input/output operations to more advanced topics such as arrays, enums, and structs. The assignments are designed to help you:

- Understand variable types, value types, and reference types in C#.
- Implement conditional logic, loops, and basic calculations.
- Work with arrays and multidimensional arrays to solve common problems.
- Develop programs to calculate simple interest, BMI, and check prime numbers.
- Explore C# enums for managing days, seasons, and permissions.

    and modifying the value of one variable and mention what will
    happen**

3.  **Write C# program that Assigning one reference type variable to
    another and modifying the object through one variable and mention
    what will happen**

**Assignment 4 **

**Arrays **

**1- **

**. Write a program that prints an identity matrix using for** **loop, in other words takes a value n from the user and shows the** **identity table of size n \* n. **

**2- **

**3- **

**Write a program in C\# Sharp to merge two arrays of the same** **size sorted in ascending order. **

**4- **

**0 **

**7 **

**5 **

**3 **

**write a program to find the longest distance between Two equal** **cells. In this example. The distance is measured by the number Of** **cells- for example, the distance between the first and the fourth** **cell is 2 \(cell 2 and cell 3\). **

**In the example above, the longest distance is between the first 7 **

**11- Write a Program to Print One Dimensional Array in Reverse** **Order **

****

**General** **1-Write a program that calculates the simple interest given the** **principal amount, rate of interest, and time. The formula for** **simple interest is **

**Interest = \(principal \* rate \* time \) /100 2- Write a program** **that calculates the Body Mass Index \(BMI\) given a person's** **weight in kilograms and height in meters. The formula for BMI** **is **

**BMI = \(Weight\)/\(Height\*Height\)** **3-Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if** **the temperature is too hot, too cold, or just good. Assign the** **result in a variable then display the result. Assume that below** **10 degrees is "Just Cold", above 30 degrees is **

**"Just Hot", and anything else is "Just Good" **

**Today's date : 20 – 11 – 2001 5-What is the** **output of the following C\# code? **

**DateTime date = new DateTime\(2024, 6, 14\);** **Console.WriteLine\($"The event is on \{date:MM/dd/yyyy\}"\);** **a\) **

**The event is on 14/06/2024 **

    > to Sunday) as its members. Then, write a C# program that prints
    > out all the days of the week using this enum.

<!-- -->

    > Summer, Autumn, Winter) as its members. Write a C# program that
    > takes a season name as input from the user and displays the
    > corresponding month range for that season. Note range for seasons
    > ( spring march to may , summer june to august , autumn September
    > to November , winter December to February)

[3]{dir="rtl"}- Assign the following Permissions (Read, write, Delete,
Execute) in a form of Enum.
